## Development

### Environment Setup

For detail, refer to [installation](/doc/docs/getting-started.md#installation).

### Code Style

[rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) is used.

```bash
# in src directory
cargo fmt
```

### Linting

[Clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/clippy/) is used.

```bash
# in src directory
cargo clippy
```

### Structure

<img alt="piccolo overview" src="../images/overview.png"
width="75%"
height="75%"
/>

For detail, refer to [Structure](/doc/docs/structure.md).

### Build

The first priority is to use Containers, but direct build is also possible. (However, build errors may occur depending on the system.)  
The project is using [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) as its build system and command is wrapped in [Makefile](/Makefile).

The binaries and other artifacts (such as the man pages) can be built via:

```bash
make
# same as
cargo build
```

After successfully compiling the binaries, they will be in `./target`.

You can use these directly, but it is recommended to use containers.

```bash
# podman-kube
make image
make install
# docker compose
make up
```

For more details, refer to the [Getting started](/doc/docs/getting-started.md)

### Static Code Analysis

TBD

### Unit tests

Unit tests can be executed using following commands:

```bash
# in src directory
cargo test
```

### Integration tests

TBD

### Running

The following sections describe how to run the built application(s) locally on one machine.  
Refer to [Getting Started](/doc/docs/getting-started.md).
